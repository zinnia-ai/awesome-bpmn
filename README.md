# Open BPMN Activities

The most valuable parts of the work that we do is not *what* we do, but *how* we do it. The unique expression of our businesses are in ourselves, our interactions with our customers, and our execution. However, much of the tasks that we do on a daily basis is, to be honest, actually quite mundane. And yet we are collectively defining and re-defining these same basic activities over, and over, and over.

What do we have to lose in sharing BPMN modules for non-proprietary activities? Nothing. What do we have to gain? A lot. By sharing common activities, we are enabling Automation and the Internet of Things to interact within and between our business and our customers. We are enabling more efficient collaboration. And we are increasing the speed of excellence.

This repository is meant to include collaboration on BPMN implementations for common activities. This is by no means definitive. You can use it as a starting point and extend the activities with custom behaviours. Contributions are welcome if you find things that would be generally useful. Corrections or suggestions as well.

Let's spend less time re-defining the pre-defined and move on with our collective futures and what we came here to do -- make a difference in the world!
